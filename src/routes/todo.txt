* DRY: extract div height to variable
* can do C.I. for count = 0, obverse of count = 100% ?
* can we do arrays for label widths?
* no brackets around positive, negative, distribution labels
* positive/negative labels right by bars and group totals to left of that
* some things look cramped in layout of BarGraph
* enforce minimum width to avoid negative-width rect
* re-order groups?
* some n's on bars in strange places
* closing the group picker?
