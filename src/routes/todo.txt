* test all groups
* size BarGraph to fit data vertically
* no brackets around positive, negative, distribution labels
* positive/negative labels right by bars and group totals to left of that
* some things look cramped in layout of BarGraph
* re-order groups?
* some n's on bars in strange places
* closing the group picker?
